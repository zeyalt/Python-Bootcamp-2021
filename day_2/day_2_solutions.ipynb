    "### How to end the `if` block\n",
    "\n",
    "In the solution above, our `if` block compares `command` explicitly to each of the three possible commands, and uses the `else` to raise an error in the event that we receive a command we don't know.\n",
    "We could have written, just as easily, the following `if` block:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "if command == \"forward\":\n",
    "    horiz_pos += value\n",
    "elif command == \"up\":\n",
    "    depth -= value\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    depth += value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This block assumes that the variable `command` _always_ contains one of the three known commands, and thus uses the `else` to handle the `down` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a disadvantage to writing code like this:\n",
    "one cannot look at the `if` block and _read_ what is the third case.\n",
    "Is it a single one?\n",
    "Are there multiple commands that map to the action of doing `depth += value`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, one can argue it is preferable to be explicit about the cases we are handling.\n",
    "Of course, we can still choose to write the `if` block like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "if command == \"forward\":\n",
    "    horiz_pos += value\n",
    "elif command == \"up\":\n",
    "    depth -= value\n",
    "elif command == \"down\":\n",
    "    depth += value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference, here, is that we do not include the `else` branch with the `raise` statement.\n",
    "This says explicitly the commands that we are handling, while also showing that we do not expect to have to handle anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another slight variant would be to write\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "if command == \"forward\":\n",
    "    horiz_pos += value\n",
    "elif command == \"up\":\n",
    "    depth -= value\n",
    "elif command == \"down\":\n",
    "    depth += value\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This variant can be understood to mean “we assume something else might come through in the variable `command`, but we don't care about it”.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just minor variations of one another, and _your_ interpretation might not necessarily align with mine, but I find it to be an interesting exercise to think about the different ways in which similar pieces of code are read and understood.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Let us analyse the the space and time complexities of our solution, as a function of the number `n` of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rule of thumb to estimate the time complexity of an algorithm is to sum the time complexities of things that happen after each other, and to multiply the time complexities of loops with the time complexities of the code inside them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our particular example, we have an outer `for` loop that goes through all instructions once, so that loop by itself is linear, or $O(n)$.\n",
    "Now, we need to check the time complexity of the loop body, because the loop body gets executed in _each_ iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, all operations inside the loop body execute in constant time: they do not depend on the total amount of instructions.\n",
    "Hence, the loop body, for each iteration, is $O(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together (in a not-so-rigorous manner), we get that the whole algorithm is $O(n) \\times O(1) = O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shouldn't be surprising, and it is impossible to improve: we cannot know what the final horizontal position/depth/aim is without reading all instructions, and to read all instructions we need to go through the whole set of instructions at least once, which is already $O(n)$ by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity of our current solution is also linear, because we store all the instructions in a list.\n",
