    "\n",
    "You barely reach the safety of the cave when the whale smashes into the cave mouth, collapsing it. Sensors indicate another exit to this cave at a much greater depth, so you have no choice but to press on.\n",
    "\n",
    "As your submarine slowly makes its way through the cave system, you notice that the four-digit [seven-segment displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display) in your submarine are malfunctioning; they must have been damaged during the escape. You'll be in a lot of trouble without them, so you'd better figure out what's wrong.\n",
    "\n",

    "So, to render a `1`, only segments `c` and `f` would be turned on; the rest would be off. To render a `7`, only segments `a`, `c`, and `f` would be turned on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the signals which control the segments have been mixed up on each display. The submarine is still trying to display numbers by producing output on signal wires `a` through `g`, but those wires are connected to segments _randomly_. Worse, the wire/segment connections are mixed up separately for each four-digit display! (All of the digits _within_ a display use the same connections, though.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you might know that only signal wires `b` and `g` are turned on, but that doesn't mean _segments_ `b` and `g` are turned on: the only digit that uses two segments is `1`, so it must mean segments `c` and `f` are meant to be on. With just that information, you still can't tell which wire (`b`/`g`) goes to which segment (`c`/`f`). For that, you'll need to collect more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each display, you watch the changing signals for a while, make a note of _all ten unique signal patterns_ you see, and then write down a single _four digit output value_ (your puzzle input). Using the signal patterns, you should be able to work out which pattern corresponds to which digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is what you might see in a single entry in your notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab |\n",
    "cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(The entry is wrapped here to two lines so it fits; in your notes, it will all be on a single line.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each entry consists of ten _unique signal patterns_, a `|` delimiter, and finally the _four digit output value_. Within an entry, the same wire/segment connections are used (but you don't know what the connections actually are). The unique signal patterns correspond to the ten different ways the submarine tries to render a digit using the current wire/segment connections. Because `7` is the only digit that uses three segments, `dab` in the above example means that to render a `7`, signal lines `d`, `a`, and `b` are on. Because `4` is the only digit that uses four segments, `eafb` means that to render a `4`, signal lines `e`, `a`, `f`, and `b` are on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this information, you should be able to work out which combination of signal wires corresponds to each of the ten digits. Then, you can decode the four digit output value. Unfortunately, in the above example, all of the digits in the output value (`cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf`) use five segments and are more difficult to deduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, _focus on the easy digits_. Consider this larger example:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have a way of generating all the different permutations of the letters `\"abcdefg\"`, we can implement our brute-force solution.\n",
    "It is going to work this way:\n",
    "\n",
    " - we pre-compute all possible ways of reordering the signals based off of the permutations of `\"abcdefg\"` (pre-computing them means we save time across lines of the input);\n",
    " - we are going to read the input line by line and split it into the left and right-hand sides of the `\" | \"`;\n",
    " - we are going to look for the correct ordering of the signals based off of the left-hand side of the input line; and\n",
    " - when the correct ordering is found, we use it to transform the right-hand side signals and we compute the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know if a given ordering is the correct one?\n",
    "Let's revisit the example above:\n",
    "\n",
    "The input line\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "acedgfb cdfbe gcdfa fbcad dab cefabd cdfgeb eafb cagedb ab |\n",
    "cdfeb fcadb cdfeb cdbaf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "matches this reordering of the signals:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " dddd\n",
    "e    a\n",
    "e    a\n",
    " ffff\n",
    "g    b\n",
    "g    b\n",
    " cccc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be represented by the string `\"deafgbc\"`, which maps to `\"abcdefg\"` to produce the original ordering of the segments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " aaaa\n",
    "b    c\n",
    "b    c\n",
    " dddd\n",
    "e    f\n",
    "e    f\n",
    " gggg\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for each ordering, like `\"deafgbc\"`, we map it to `\"abcdefg\"` and figure out what digits are being represented.\n",
    "For example, the original input line contained the signals `\"cdfbe\"`, which would represent the following digit:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " dddd\n",
    "e    .\n",
    "e    .\n",
    " ffff\n",
    ".    b\n",
    ".    b\n",
    " cccc\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a 5, so this is a hint that the ordering `\"deafgbc\"` could be the correct ordering.\n",
    "For an ordering to be correct, we must be able to build all _ten_ digits out of the original input line.\n",
    "An ordering is incorrect when it maps to something that is not a valid digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the same input line, the ordering `\"decfgba\"` would map to this ordering of the segments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    " dddd\n",
    "e    c\n",
    "e    c\n",
    " ffff\n",
    "g    b\n",
    "g    b\n",
    " aaaa\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which means that the signals `\"cdfbe\"` now represent the following:\n",

    "```\n",
    " dddd\n",
    "e    c\n",
    "e    c\n",

    ".    b\n",
    " ....\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which is not a valid digit.\n",

    "\n",
    " 1. set difference with `-`: `set1 - set2` is equivalent to `{elem for elem in s1 if elem not in s2}`;\n",
    " 2. `frozenset`: a frozen set is an immutable set, and it's the only type of set that can be contained inside another set;\n",
    " 3. `set.pop`: the method `.pop` of sets returns a random element from within the set and removes it. When used on sets with a single element (like above) it returns the only element in the set; and\n",
    " 4. set inclusion with `<`: `set1 < set2` checks if `set1` is strictly contained within `set2` and is equivalent to `all(elem in set2 for elem in set1) and len(set2) > len(set1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "One small thing to note is the pattern `set - {elem}` that was used a couple of times in the above.\n",
    "This is one way of removing an element from a set, but there are two methods that would achieve the same effect:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `a_set.remove(x)`, which removes the element `x` from `a_set` and raises an error if `x` isn't in the set; and\n",
    " - `a_set.discard(x)`, which tries to remove the element `x` from `a_set` but doesn't complain if the element isn't there.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because both these methods mutate the same set, and we were trying to compute new sets, we opted to go for the expression `set - {elem}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than modifying the order of the logical deductions, there isn't much to be changed in this specific implementation of our solution, but we can look at another way of identifying the digits that is even more straightforward."
