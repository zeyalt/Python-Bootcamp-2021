    "The sea floor is getting steeper. Maybe the sleigh keys got carried this way?\n",

    "A massive school of glowing [lanternfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanternfish) swims past. They must spawn quickly to reach such large numbers - maybe _exponentially_ quickly? You should model their growth rate to be sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you know nothing about this specific species of lanternfish, you make some guesses about their attributes. Surely, each lanternfish creates a new lanternfish once every _7_ days.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this process isn't necessarily synchronized between every lanternfish - one lanternfish might have 2 days left until it creates another lanternfish, while another might have 4. So, you can model each fish as a single number that represents _the number of days until it creates a new lanternfish_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, you reason, a _new_ lanternfish would surely need slightly longer before it's capable of producing more lanternfish: two more days for its first cycle.\n",

    "Realizing what you're trying to do, the submarine automatically produces a list of the ages of several hundred nearby lanternfish (your puzzle input). For example, suppose you were given the following list:\n",
